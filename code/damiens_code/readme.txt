cop_out_code contains the code that creates a batch for every relevant subdomain of the problem

dd_pinns is where I was trying to develop the neural domain tree that would take in the full batch of points
and decide what to do with them later

test contains a variety of jupyter notebooks with tests so that I could understand some of the
classes and functions I was developing without having to mess with everything in the Pendulum_DD code

Pendulum_DD contains a slightly modified version of Amanda's code that actually works.
